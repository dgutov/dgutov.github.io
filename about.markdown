My name is Dmitry Gutov, I'm a software developer from Saint-Petersburg living in Cyprus.

I have a decade plus of experience writing web applications, largely
focusing on the backend and Ruby/Rails/Grape/etc. I also feel rather
strongly about proper software testing and developer tools.

Most of my free software work is related to Emacs. I'll be blogging
about it here sometimes. See [my GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dgutov) page for more
details, and maybe chip in, if you find my work useful.

I'm currently open for new engagements and contract work.
