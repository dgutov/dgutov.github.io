My name is Dmitry Gutov, I'm a software developer from Saint-Petersburg living in Cyprus.

I have a decade plus of experience writing web applications, largely
focusing on the backend and Ruby/Rails/Grape/etc. I also feel rather
strongly about proper software testing and developer tools.

Most of my free software work is related to Emacs. I'll be blogging
about it here, probably.
